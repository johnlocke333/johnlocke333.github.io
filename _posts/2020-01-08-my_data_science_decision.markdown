I believe my path to data science came very naturally. Ever since I was a child, I was extremely attracted to mathematics and its processes and applications to the real world. I first became curious with how production and services were distributed throughout the world and with how this process worked monetarily. I later learned this was the ideology behind the study of economics. Instinctively, when the time came to further my education, I decided to attend a liberal arts university and major in economics. From there I gained a strong mathematical and analytical background. Additionally, during my time in school, I began to take an interest in coding. 

While in college, I took introduction to computer science, data structures, computer systems, and foundations of computation. I thoroughly enjoyed all of these courses, but I did not start attending computer science courses until my junior year of college. The courses were simply for enjoyment and never for the intention of real world application. Therefore, when I accepted my first job post graduation, coding was never in my scope. 

I accepted a job unrelated to my true interests, and became unhappy relatively quickly; this is when data science became clear to me. I began to analyze my background and enjoyments. My strong mathematical background and interest in coding, quickly lead me to the path of data science. I wanted to confirm my enthusiasm so I took a month long online course titled, "Beginners Python and Math for Data Science". My interests were confirmed, and I decided the risk was well worth it. 

Finally, I began to look for programs that could facilitate my new educational path. Flatiron School became the clear choice for me. The combination of reputation and passion was extremely inviting. The experience so far has been nothing short of fantastic, constantly driving me to learn more. The evolution of data science is a path I look forward to riding for the rest of my career.
